/*
    Assuming the RBM has been trained (so that weights for the network have been learned),
    run the network on a set of visible units, to get a sample of the hidden units.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: A matrix where each row consists of the states of the visible units.

    Returns
    -------
    hidden_states: A matrix where each row consists of the hidden units activated from the visible
    units in the data matrix passed in.
