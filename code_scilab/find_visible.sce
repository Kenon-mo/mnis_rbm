/*    """
    Assuming the RBM has been trained (so that weights for the network have been learned),
    run the network on a set of hidden units, to get a sample of the visible units.
    Parameters
    ----------
    data: A matrix where each row consists of the states of the hidden units.
    Returns
    -------
    visible_states: A matrix where each row consists of the visible units activated from the hidden
    units in the data matrix passed in.
